1) Create your card using the “item card” file, hiding/showing layers and changing the numbers as necessary.
2) Flatten the image (discarding all hidden layers).
3) Change the image size to 825x1125 (resample to nearest neighbor to preserve pixel art).
4) Copy the whole thing then paste it into the background folder of the “gamecrafter setup” file.
5) Edit the final body text.
6) Save as PDF, this is what you’ll eventually send to TGC.
